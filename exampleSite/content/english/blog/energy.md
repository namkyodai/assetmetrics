### Energy Audit for Buildings

To support our goal of sustainable outcomes for our Clients, we have developed
solutions to optimize their energy usage providing a range of benefits to the
building owner and occupants.

The audits come with three different levels of comprehensiveness. Every building
and building owner is different and is looking to archive different objectives.
For some it is essential for commercial viability, for others something they
would like some expert inputs on before considering further. We have detailed
the options below:

#### Level 1 - Walkthrough Assessment and Review of Operational Data

A simple and basic audit that involves a review of utility bills, interviews
with site operating personnel, and a walkthrough of the facility. The purpose is
to see glaring areas of energy inefficiency and uncover major problem areas.
Data is compiled to produce a preliminary report with no-cost/low-cost measures
and potential capital improvements for further study. This level of detail is
enough to prioritize energy efficiency projects and assess the need for a more
detailed audit.

#### Level 2 - Energy Survey and Analysis

A Level 2 audit builds on the preliminary ASHRAE Level 1 analysis and would
include a more detailed data collection, energy calculation, and financial
analysis of proposed energy efficiency measures. The level of detail would be
adequate to justify project implementation.

#### Level 3 - Detailed Analysis and Modelling

This level focuses on the potential capital-intensive projects identified in the
Level 2 analysis. It would involve more detailed data gathering as well as a
more rigorous engineering analysis and modelling. Existing data will be
supplemented with sub-metering and operations monitoring for major energy
consuming systems.

### Energy Audit for Industrial Plants and Factories

Levels of works are similar to that for Energy Audit of Building. However,
additional focus will be on using
