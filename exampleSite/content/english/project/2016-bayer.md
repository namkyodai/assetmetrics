title: "Technical Due Diligence for Bayer House"
summary: "Bayer House is a five-storey office used building with an approximate building floor area of 4,624 square meter which was occupied at year 1999. The building is a bearing wall system with flat slab and is located approximately 5.6 km away from the main active seismic source which is the is the East and West Marikina Valley Fault System."

## Clients
[Bayer Philippines Inc.](https://www.bayer.com/)

## The Project
Bayer House is a five-storey office used building with an approximate building floor area of 4,624 square meter which was occupied at year 1999. The building is a bearing wall system with flat slab and is located approximately 5.6 km away from the main active seismic source which is the is the East and West Marikina Valley Fault System.

The team has been appointed by Bayer Philippines Incorporated to carry out structural assessment of the building to be in line with the latest National Structural Code of Philippines (NSCP 2010) and to propose a concept level structural upgrading and strengthening measures to avoid any severe damage to the existing building during earthquake; conduct due diligence on the Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing and Fire Protection (MEPF) services; and provide a proposal on the retrofitting design and details for all structural elements that are found to be structurally insufficient under the building code.

## Objectives
The purpose of this due diligence is to identify any material deficiency and the conditions of the subject property. The practice in this report consists of the following components:

* Conduct survey by visual screening of the existing building and assess how their present condition will affect performance during an earthquake event.
* Carry out Intrusive Testing such as Coring, Rebar Scanning and Concrete Carbonation to determine the actual strength and degradation of the concrete.
* Review of existing and as-built drawings of the facility and documents given by building owners or the facility manager.
* To identify the performance and response of the building to ground shaking during an earthquake event.
* To provide concept design of structural upgrading and strengthening methods necessary for the building components/members which do not meet the required performance criteria.

## Scopes
* Structural Assessment\
The evaluation is limited to the assessment of the structureâ€™s performance against possible seismic loads and hazards. The flow of work are as follows:

  *	Data collection using available information given by the Client and from site survey and testing procedure.
  *	Analyze the building using Static and Dynamic Analysis procedure.
  *	Check the local and global response and required against actual capacity.
  *	Provide concept design of structural upgrading and strengthening measures for non-conforming elements.
* MEPF Assessment:
  *	Building permission (compliance with building codes & regulations, test certificates; fire department certification, elevator certification);
  *	Acceptance of authorities and / or experts;
  *	Directly visible deviation from building permission requirements, identified by the team during the site visit.

The review of regulatory requirements will be focused on potential material issues, i.e. issues that hold a financial risk above threshold.
