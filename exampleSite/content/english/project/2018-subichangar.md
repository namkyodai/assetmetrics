## The Project
The project is for the detailed engineering design of the retrofitting, rehabilitation and modification of the Hangar Facility. The project scope also includes preparation of technical tender documents and detailed cost estimate and bill of quantities. Part of the service is to provide technical support to the client for the site inspection during construction and any amendments or clarifications needed to maintain the program.

* Structural 3d modelling and design evaluation using latest NSCP 2015 7th edition and AISC 14th edition codes to check if there are inadequacy in the existing member if columns are to be removed and relocated to suit larger aircrafts.
* Develop layout options, primarily to allow Gulfstream G650 aircraft to be parked inside which has a required wing span clearance of 33m.
* Prepare cost estimates, of similar accuracy and cost parameters to the previous exercise, for each of the layouts developed in Part (a); and
* Advise the likely impact on previous and current cost estimates as a result of changes in the market (i.e. steel price) since the December 2017 report.
