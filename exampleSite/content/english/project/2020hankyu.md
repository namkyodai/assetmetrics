## The project
The Client engaged the team to perform an extensive TDD work to evaluate the condition and operation states of a 30 storey high-rise building located in a strategic location in Bonifacio Global City (BGC).

The project has been conducted within 3 weeks including 1-2 weeks jointed visual inspection and assessment to the site and 1 week analyzing and reporting the findings.

Based on the findings, the team has helped the Client in arriving at optimal decision regarding the strategy on commercial negociation with the building's owners.

## Innovation and Lessons Learned
  In order to satisfy a very tight schedule and detailed requirements of the Japanese Client. The team has mobilized a team of highly qualified and senior engineer. A tabular sheet was initiated using the concept of Asset Management, with clear level of asset hierarchy.

A program was coded in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to allow automation of analysis and report compilation.

For example, the following graph show the distribution of Capex expenses per disciplines in 10 years. This graph was generated automatically by an R code given the data.

The graph was then saved as default in a designated subfolder for use of reporting, which is done by using a high-quality typsetting system named [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/).

By using this platform, the team has eliminated all time consuming task if using a conventional approach with Ms Word.
