## The Project
[Hanjin Shipyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanjin_Heavy_Industries_and_Construction_Philippines) is one of the biggest and largest heavy Shipyard in the world. It was constructed by Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Philippines (HHIC Phil). It was in operation from 2006 and has commissioned a number of large commercial ships and oil tankers for global Clients.

Since 2018, HHIC Phil faced financial challenges and filed for bankruptcy. In 2020, the Shipyard has attracted a Global Capital Investment Firm, who wishes to take the ownership of the entire shipyard by executing an Distressed Investment.

The Global Capital Investment Firm (name is confidential) has engaged the team to perform an extensive exercise and work on both Technical Due Diligence and Environmental Due Diligence.

The project has been carried out in 3 months with two phases.

## The Objectives
* Phase 1

  * Visual Inspection of facilities of the Shipyard;
  * Review historical records on corrective and interventive Intervention;
  * Risk ranking for facilities;
  * Estimation of high level CAPEX based on risk scores and areas.
* Phase 2
  * Assessment and evaluation of condition and performance of assets
  * Create layout drawings of utilities for tenant's separation purposes. This will be used as inputs for layers to draft contracts with prospective tenants
  * Cost study for 50 years for all facilities and utilities
  * Create a master schedule for intervention works for the next 2 years

## Innovation and Lessons Learned

Taking advantage of the system and innovation used and developed for other TDD works. The team continued to make full advantage of R programing and Latex system to perform analysis and compile the report.

  A program was coded in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to allow automation of analysis and report compilation.

  For example, the following graph show the distribution of Capex expenses per disciplines in 10 years. This graph was generated automatically by an R code given the data.

  The graph was then saved as default in a designated subfolder for use of reporting, which is done by using a high-quality typsetting system named [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/).

  By using this platform, the team has eliminated all time consuming task if using a conventional approach with Ms Word.
